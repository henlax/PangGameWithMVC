It mostly seemed like it would be fun to do, and also i thought it would gave me a bigger challenge,
as MVC seemed to not go naturally with the normal way i;m used to do it - DDOL classes that go between scenes.

Leaderboards with player names supplied at the end of the game:
It seem simple enough and a way of showing some minor UI.

I'm mostly a bit sad that I didn't had enough time to add graphics and animations.
